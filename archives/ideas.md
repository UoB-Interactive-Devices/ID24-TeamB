## Idea brainstorming
1. NFC token to bring through the users to different exhibits on the ship. Allows for customised tour
2. Mini talking characters after NFC token taps them
3. VR/AR of steering the ship
4. Treasure Hunt game with a tamagotchi in the museum to lead users to different parts of the ship 
5. Create a mobile robot with automatic obstacle avoidance function
6. Set up interactive screens or apps that allow visitors to ask questions to get real-time information about exhibits.
7. Sensor technology is used to trigger corresponding story telling based on the visitor's location and movements.
8. Provide a digital time capsule that allows visitors to upload and share stories, photos or videos related to the museum.
9. A digital drawing pad where users can draw and the drawings will get "alive" and start moving around the room
10. Shape-changing NFC token as users enter into different rooms
11. Smart Guide Bracelet: This bracelet integrates positioning, voice guide, exhibit information retrieval and other functions.
12. Digital item Recovery station: Set up some small, self-service digital object retrieval stations in the museum, if visitors lose personal belongings, they can enter a description of the lost items or upload pictures of the lost items in these sites.
13. "Exhibit Interactive feedback device". The installation is designed to enhance the interaction between visitors and the exhibits, while collecting feedback from visitors to optimize the content and layout of the exhibition, with specific functions and features.
