## Project: Intelligent Interactive Museum Art Exploration Device ##

## Goal 
Utilize 3D printing technology for creating intelligent replicas and integrate holographic projection with ChatGPT-powered artificial intelligence voice to provide museum visitors with a more interactive experience, fostering a deeper understanding and appreciation of artworks.

## Timeline 
- 4th March 
- 11th March 
- 18th March 
- 3 Week easter break 
- 15th April 
- 22nd April 

## Prototype 1 
### James Webb Technologies
- Why the James Webb telescope?
  - The latest telescope, sent out in 2021
  - Has a unique origami feature where the telescope will fold on itself
  - Having a smart replica for users to see how it folds can enhance the experience + current exhibits does not show it
  - Showcasing the images from the telescope provides a more immersie experience

### 3 Confirmed features:
1. Projection with MPU6050 and project different image
2. Light sensitive to the sun, red LED starts blinking because too hot
3. Closing closes the projection
4. ChatGPT voice recognition?
