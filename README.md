## 2 main ideas 
### Idea 1: Tangible lego exhibit
* Target audience: Children
* Why: Tangible tokens are shown to encourage greater enagagement and collaboration, which allows users to learn more
* What: A tangible game exhibit where children can solve a lego activity together. It has to be solved by >=2 people. Progress bar will be shown at the side, and once solved, the completed piece will light up

### Idea 2: Tangible treasure Hunt 
* Target Audience: Children/Adults
* Why: Research has shown that a treasure hunt could guide users to be more engaged
* What: Users will be given a map at the start of the exhibit. Users can go to the different sections of the exhibits to collect lego pieces/tokens. Once completed, it can be formed as a key to a treasure box

## Ideas 
1. NFC token to bring through the users to different exhibits on the ship. Allows for customised tour
2. Mini talking characters after NFC token taps them
3. VR/AR of steering the ship
4. Treasure Hunt game with a tamagotchi in the museum to lead users to different parts of the ship 
5. Create a mobile robot with automatic obstacle avoidance function
6. Set up interactive screens or apps that allow visitors to ask questions to get real-time information about exhibits.
7. Sensor technology is used to trigger corresponding story telling based on the visitor's location and movements.
8. Provide a digital time capsule that allows visitors to upload and share stories, photos or videos related to the museum.
9. A digital drawing pad where users can draw and the drawings will get "alive" and start moving around the room
10. Shape-changing NFC token as users enter into different rooms
11. Smart Guide Bracelet: This bracelet integrates positioning, voice guide, exhibit information retrieval and other functions.
12. Digital item Recovery station: Set up some small, self-service digital object retrieval stations in the museum, if visitors lose personal belongings, they can enter a description of the lost items or upload pictures of the lost items in these sites.
13. "Exhibit Interactive feedback device". The installation is designed to enhance the interaction between visitors and the exhibits, while collecting feedback from visitors to optimize the content and layout of the exhibition, with specific functions and features.
14. Create a digital online map of museum to guide tourists.
15. Project some motion-sensing games the museum grounds to prevent visitors feeling bored while waiting.
16. VR/AR: VR creates full virtual experiences, while AR enhances reality with digital overlays for interactive experiences blending real and virtual.
17. AI: AI streamlines data processing and decision-making, offering predictive analysis and smart suggestions.
18. 3D Printing: This tech allows quick creation of complex models, speeding up design processes and cutting costs.
