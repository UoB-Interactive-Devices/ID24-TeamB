## Ideas 
1. NFC token to bring through the users to different exhibits on the ship. Allows for customised tour
2. Mini talking characters after NFC token taps them
3. VR/AR of steering the ship/ the journey that the ship took
4. Treasure Hunt game with a tamagotchi/compass in the museum to lead users to different parts of the ship 
5. Create a mobile robot with automatic obstacle avoidance function
6. Set up interactive screens or apps that allow visitors to ask questions to get real-time information about exhibits.
7. Sensor technology is used to trigger corresponding story telling based on the visitor's location and movements.
8. Provide a digital time capsule that allows visitors to upload and share stories, photos or videos related to the museum.
