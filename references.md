* The algorithm allows visitors to photograph items and instantly retrieve detailed information about them. Object recognition system implemented using SURF algorithm. The system matches input images to model images in the database using interest point correspondences between pairs of images. The recognition score is determined based on the number of matches, and the object with the highest score is selected as the recognition object.
