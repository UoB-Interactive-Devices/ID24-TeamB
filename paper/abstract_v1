Abstract (Carina)
- Currently, many museum exhibits can only be seen at a distance 
- Museum experience might be boring and removed from the exhibit
- Recent studies look at making interactive musuem replicas 
- Our solution: Creating a interactive smart museum replica that allows user to understand the exhibit more 
- Having a proof of concept of making an interactive smart replica can allow this application for most museum exhibits
